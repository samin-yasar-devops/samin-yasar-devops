# Hi, I'm Samin Yasar 👋

I'm a DevOps & Platform Engineer with over 10 years of experience building secure, scalable, and highly available infrastructure across cloud and on-premise environments. I specialize in using automation, Infrastructure as Code, and CI/CD practices to solve complex engineering challenges and accelerate developer productivity.

## 🚀 About Me
- Designed and deployed a 70-node Kubernetes cluster using KVM, HAProxy, and Virtual IPs to enable high availability for microservices.
- Led a multi-phase migration from monolith to microservices, integrating CI/CD pipelines with GitLab and Helm, and managing hybrid cloud connectivity with AWS Transit Gateway.
- Built reusable Terraform modules for ECS Fargate, VPC, RDS, and EFS, enabling standardized infrastructure deployment across multiple environments.
- Developed ETL workflows using Apache Airflow across 30+ production databases to centralize analytics for executive dashboards.
- Implemented centralized observability platforms using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack, reducing MTTR significantly.
- Led cost-optimization and performance-improvement initiatives across cloud environments, saving thousands in monthly AWS spend.
- Advocated for and implemented inclusive DevOps practices, promoting psychological safety and mentoring junior engineers.
